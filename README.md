# Capstone-Project-3---Online-Retail-Shop-Analysis
This analysis looks into Customer Segmentation and Market Basket Analysis.

This is an individual project done over 11 days. I've downloaded the Online Retail dataset from Kaggle. This time round I have used python to do up majority part of the analysis. This includes Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) calculation, segmenting the customers based on the RF Grid and preparing the respective tables to be loaded into Power BI for visualisation. With the customers segment into 10 different groups, in accordance with the RF Grid, I've done up a rough marketing strategies (see images below). I must put a disclaimer that I'm not a marketing guy, so please pardon me if the strategy does not hold ground. But I'm sure the marketing people will see value with the customer segmentation work done here.

As an alternative to RFM, I've also done up the customer segmentation using kmeans (unsupervised clustering algorithm). This is done up to draw a comparison between the 2 techniques (RFM being statistical modelling vs kmeans being machine learning modelling).

To wrap up the entire analysis, I've done up a Market Basket Analysis using Apriori and Association Rule Mining. This is needed so that other than understanding our customers via Customer Segmentation, we also need to understand our items popularity, along with the customer buying pattern. The analysis will yield frequent itemsets and association rule which will be useful for cross selling and up selling of our items.
